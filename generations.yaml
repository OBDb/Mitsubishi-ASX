    description: "The first-generation Mitsubishi ASX (known as RVR in Japan and Outlander Sport in North America) was introduced as Mitsubishi's entry in the rapidly growing compact crossover segment. Built on a shortened version of the Outlander platform, it featured distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'Jet Fighter' front grille design, a sloping roofline, and compact dimensions appealing to urban buyers. Initially powered by a range of engines including a 1.6L and 1.8L gasoline and a 1.8L diesel in European markets, while North America received a 2.0L four-cylinder producing approximately 148 horsepower. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, CVT, and in some markets, a 6-speed automated manual. Available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations using Mitsubishi's All Wheel Control (AWC) system. The interior offered a straightforward, functional design with a focus on durability rather than luxury, though higher trims included features like a panoramic glass roof, touchscreen infotainment, and premium audio systems. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the ASX provided a spacious cabin with flexible seating and cargo arrangements. The model received numerous refreshes throughout its unusually long production run, with significant facelifts in 2013, 2016, and 2020 bringing updated styling, improved technology, and refined powertrains to keep it competitive. The ASX became one of Mitsubishi's most successful global models, particularly in Europe and Australia, due to its combination of practicality, value, and manageable size."

    description: "The second-generation Mitsubishi ASX represents a dramatic shift in the model's development, now based on the Renault Captur following Mitsubishi's integration into the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. The exterior features Mitsubishi-specific styling elements including a distinctive interpretation of the brand's Dynamic Shield front design, though the overall silhouette and proportions closely resemble its Renault counterpart. Dimensionally similar to the outgoing model but with more modern packaging for improved interior space. Powertrain options reflect the Renault origins, including a 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing approximately 90 horsepower, a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 140 horsepower, and a 1.6-liter hybrid system combining a gasoline engine with an electric motor for a total system output of around 145 horsepower. Some markets also receive a plug-in hybrid variant with approximately 30 miles of electric-only range. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic depending on engine. The interior represents a significant upgrade over the previous generation with a more contemporary design featuring a 7-inch (or optional 9.3-inch) vertical touchscreen infotainment system, a digital instrument cluster, and improved materials throughout. Advanced safety technology includes lane keeping assist, traffic sign recognition, and autonomous emergency braking. Built in Spain alongside the Renault Captur, the new ASX is primarily focused on European markets where the original model achieved its greatest success. This generation marks a new approach for Mitsubishi in Europe, leveraging Alliance synergies to deliver a thoroughly modernized product while reducing development costs."
